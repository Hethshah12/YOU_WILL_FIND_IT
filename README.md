# YOU_WILL_FIND_IT
two medium based CTF challenges

This repository contains advanced **CTF-style cybersecurity challenges** that blend **real-world cyber attacks with adversarial AI/security concepts**.  
The challenges are designed to be **hard**, requiring reverse engineering, anomaly detection, and creative problem-solving.

##  Challenges

1. **Poisoned IoT Firmware Update**  
   - Reverse-engineer a poisoned IoT firmware binary.  
   - Find the hidden malicious code and extract the C2 server address.  
   - Flag format: `flag{iot_firmware_backdoor_detected}`  
      [Challenge 1](./Challenge1-IoT-Firmware/)

2. **Poisoned Threat Intelligence Feed**  
   - Analyze a manipulated TI feed.  
   - Identify poisoned entries and reconstruct the hidden C2 domains.  
   - Flag format: `flag{ti_feed_poisoning_success}`  
      [Challenge 2](./Challenge2-TI-Feed/)
