      CHALLENGE 2
========================

Welcome to Challenge 2!

Inside this folder, you will find a secret challenge file and a picture. 
The file is password-protected, and the password is hidden somewhere in the picture. 

Hints:
1. Look carefully at the picture. It holds the clue to open the folder.
2. The password follows a common naming style called camelCase.
3. Once you unlock the folder, you'll find another file containing the encoded flag.
4. Decoding might require multiple steps â€” pay attention to the content.

Good luck!
